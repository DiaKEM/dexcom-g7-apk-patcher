Sorry üòï - unfortunately it is not legal to offer pre-built APKs but offer software which patches software ü§Ø. Just follow the instructions to patch a stock `.apk`.

## Introduction

`Dexcom G7 APK-Patcher` is a simple tool which allows you to modify the official `.apk`-file.

There were also similar approaches for the G6 `.apk` which offered the same capability. If you are interested you can just check it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dexcom/comments/fqvpsf/oc_build_your_own_dexcom_app_update_base_version/).

## Modifications

### AndroidAPS Broadcasting

This `mod` allows you to transfer your Dexcom G7 data to AndroidAPS and also supports backfilling.

#### Requirements

You will have to install a specific AndroidAPS version which supports G7 integration: https://github.com/DiaKEM/dexcom-g7-aaps

#### Known issue: Data Smoothing

As you might know as Looper and G7 user there is no data smoothing included in G7 at all. Dexcom has no statement about the G7 specifically but
regarding G6 which might be still valid from their side: https://www.dexcom.com/en-us/faqs/why-does-past-cgm-data-look-different-from-past-data-on-receiver-and-follow-app

To overcome this issue @blaqone adviced to use smoothing directly in AndroidAPS and here we go: https://github.com/nightscout/AndroidAPS/pull/2141.
This nice PR implements not only smoothing but also backward smoothing and guarantees nice interpretable data. 

Please note that there is also an alternative approach with XDrip+ as middleware between Dexcom G7 and AAPS to just achieve the same. 
**AS I UNDERSTOOD** the only disadvantage with XDrip+ is its disability of backfilling data and missing SMBs in AAPS

### Decrease required android version 

This `mod` just lowers the minimum and targeted android sdk version. 
Unfortunately this **does not** mean that the app will run on older devices 
without any troubles but you can give it a try and check it on your own. 

### Disable compatibility check

This `mod` bypasses the compatibility check by hiding the own device information and setting it to static values. A working combination was `Google Pixel 4`.

The corresponding diff looks like this:

### Enable Screenshots

This small `mod` disables `WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_SECURE` to enable screenshots in the application.

## How to patch?

### Requirements

> :warning: The patcher is actually only **fully compatible with Linux / Unix operating systems**.
> Unfortunately `apktool` can generate different filenames on Windows OS which makes the application of the modifications impossible.
> Please use the patcher only on Linux / Unix operating systems to ensure correct results.

The patcher will come with its own tools and does not require any high level dependencies actually. But we need:

* Linux / Unix OS
* Java
* GIT

### Build

After installing all requirements you can proceed as following:

* Download official `Dexcom G7.apk` from apkure or other portal
* **OPTIONAL** Open `bin/build.sh` and comment out `mods` you do not need you do not need!
* Run `bin/build.sh path_to_apk`
* Congratulations - you just created your patched `Dexcom G7.apk`

### Docker for Linux x64
* copy dockerfile in an empty directory under linux x64
* run >>  docker build -t g7patcher .
* start container >> docker run -it -v $(pwd)/g7:/g7 g7patcher
* look in /tmp for Dexcom_G7_patched.apk
* install this file on your phone

### Reverse Engineering

The following section describes the toolset and development flow i am using. It should serve only as inspiration. I am sure that better tools and flows exists.

* You can use `jadx-gui` for investigating the code - because it is much easier to read decompiled then disassembled code.
* For editing `.smali` files i am just using `lvim` but any other basic IDE or text editor is just fine
* Android Studio (includes much more then required tools) or Genymotion to create an emulator instance

After modifications you can just run `bin/dev-build.sh`. This will rebuild the source, package it and also add the signature. Finally the Dexcom app will be reinstalled on your emulator/device to reflect the changes.
